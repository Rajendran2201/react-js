# Creating State

Sometimes, we need some variable values that may change quite often in the webpage. In such cases, React goes in very handy. This feature is so significant that it acts as a predominant feature that differentiates it from mere HTML code.

This can be done using the built-in method `useState` which returns two attributes - a variable and a function. The variable holds the current value and the method which is used to change the variable's value.

For example, Let's try to change some text on the webpage on clicking a button.
